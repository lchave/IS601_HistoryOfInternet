      <p>After the bubble burst and the market crash the MP3 player was developed. With this innovation users could compress music and distribute it online. Napster’s founder was just another college kid trying to sift through good music with his buddies when he realized he could compress these tracks and send it over the web. He coded his development and found an online community of music lovers and began to share music. In a matter of days music sharing swelled to millions of online users. Shawn Fanning, later created Napster, the website where users could download free music</p>
      <br/>
      <p>The issue with Napster was the violation of copyrights laws, Napster was allowing users to steal music, and this forced Napster to shut down. Still the idea was out there, creating social rooms where like-minded people could communicate and share common interests.</p>
      <h3 class="text-center">Social Media</h3>
      <br/>
      <p>The internet once again had revolutionized the way users interacted with it. And with the help of the MP3 player individuals had the ability to easily post and share online. New social rooms were created from this idea.
        <b>This is a short list of social media pioneers:</b>
        <i>Friendster,</i>
        <i>MySpace,</i>
        <i>Facebook,</i>
        <i>Youtube,</i>
        <i>Digg...</i>
      </p>
      <br/><br/>
      <p>There is a new order and people are now in charge of what they consume. Digg’s co-founder Jay Adelson, said “who do you trust? Some top executive or your peers and the people who are connected to you?” Jay Adelson created a news room where people essentially voted on what should be top news.
      </p>
      <p>YouTube CEO and co-founder Chad Hurley understood the power of connecting people to information and created a platform where individuals had the ability to be broadcasted without the enormous budget backing and the need for sophisticated equipment.
      </p>
      <p>And the infamous Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and founder of Facebook, says his vision is to map out relationships all around the world.
      </p>
      <p>At a minimum these platforms form the new wave of entertainment and communication but there is more to attribute to the web…

      <h3 class="text-center">WEB 2.0</h3>
      <br/>
      <p>The web is so much more now than it was at the start of Yahoo.com, it started as a collection of banner ads but quickly became what Metcalfe envisioned it could be, a huge web of communication and information. He was on target when he stated “the internet gathers momentum as it goes”.
      </p>
      <p>Aside from the greatness of YouTube videos as a resource, we now have e-learning applications, of which is Udemy.com. Here, professionals sell e-learning courses to learn technology of all sorts. Craigslist also serves millions of people by providing classified ads for work, auctions, etc.  Society has stepped into an era where Television no longer controls the narrative. You are free to watch only what interests you. Users can also easily become the news. Control and power has become as ubiquitous as the internet.

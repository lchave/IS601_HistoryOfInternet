        <p><br/></p>
        <p>Even after the Internet was made available to the public, there were not many websites and the ones that existed were not user friendly. For the most part they were just pages with text and no easy way to search them. Until 1993, when Marc Andreessen and a few other computer science students from the University of Illinois worked on creating the first user friendly browser, <b><i>Mosaic</i></b>.</p>
        <p>Mosaic was revolutionary; it had reached over one million users within nine months. Despite its success was not until Jim Clark joined forces with Andreessen and together founded <b><i>Netscape Communications Corp</i></b>, that this revolutionary technology caught the eyes of everyone, including the technology giant of the time, <b><i>Microsoft</i></b>, and its founder, Bill Gates. Microsoft was the leading technology company in the 1990s, almost 90% of the users who own a PC run Microsoft’s operating system. However, in October 1994, <b><i>Netscape Navigator</i></b> went live and just like it’s predecessor it was a success.</p>
        <p class="h3"><br/>The Beginning of the War</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-5 col-md-6">
            <p><br/>As Bill Gates realized the success of Netscape, he immediately recognized that Microsoft needed to adapt to the Internet and the World Wide Web. Some of the Microsoft and Netscape leaders had a meeting at the Netscape headquarters. As to be expected, two different ideas of how the meeting went came out of it. Microsoft’s version suggested that the meeting went great and that both companies talked for hours on how they can join their technologies. On the other hand, Netscape’s version saw this meeting as a threat where Microsoft offered to buy their technology. Right after this meeting Netscape instructed Gary Reback, their antitrust lawyer to begin the process of establishing a lawsuit against Microsoft.</p>

            <p><br/>In less than a year of launching Netscape had seen immense growth, Wall Street brokers suggested that they could be the fastest growing software company. However, it was not until August 1995, that these theories became a reality. Jim Clark had originally invested 5 million dollars to found Netscape, by the end of the first day of the company going public, he had made 663 million dollars.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-5 col-md-6">
            <p><br/><br/>As Netscape continued to grow, Microsoft called an all hands on deck in order to stop this growth, they had decided to create a browser of their own, <b><i>Internet Explorer</i></b>. Their goal was to get caught up with Netscape and little by little take the leadership in the browsers technology, not only with using their smartest assets into releasing constant improvements on their browser but also all their sales personnel. Their sales <b><i>assassins</i></b> blocked Netscape growth in every possible way. By 1997, Microsoft had 80% of the browser market share, in contrast to Netscape, Microsoft was able offer their browser for free as part of the Windows operating system.</p>

            <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Unfortunately for Microsoft, by 1998 the lawsuit started earlier by Gary Reback and Netscape had reached the U.S. Department of Justice, and the U.S Government accused Microsoft of using its operating system monopoly to control the technology market and bury competitors. At the end, the federal judge issued its final verdict recommending that Microsoft should break apart, creating a 30 billion dollars loss on Microsoft stock. Eventually, a federal appeals court decided that this verdict was too harsh and rescinded the order to the company in two.</p>

      <h1 class="text-center">Dot Com</h1>
      <br/><br/>
      <p>The era of dot com marked the momentous birth of e-commerce. Where retail moved into the internet and opened to consumers all around. As the web revolutionized the way people interacted with the computer it increased innovation, and everyone wanted a piece of the pie.  This caused a big bust of dot com sites and the stock market crush!</p>
          <br/>
      <p>Metcalfe’s law contributed to the internet phenomena. Metcalfe’s law states that the value of a communication network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system.
         This led to the innovation of creating smaller transistors small enough to carry out the doubling of communications and increase network connections

      <h3 class="text-center">AMAZON AND EBAY</h3>
      <br/>
      <p>At this time there were 2 individuals thinking hard about the internet and strategizing on ways they could benefit from the internet. Ebay co-founder approached the web as a hobby and never imagined becoming a billionaire from trading collectibles. Whereas Amazon’s co-founder understood there was money to be made online.</p>
      <br/>
      <p><b><i>EBay</i></b></p>
       <p>Pierre Morad Omidyar is a French-American billionaire entrepreneur, software engineer and philanthropist. He became a billionaire at the age of 31 with eBay's 1998 initial public offering.</p>
    <br/>
      <p><b><i>Amazon</i></b></p>
      <p>Jeffrey Preston Bezos is an American internet entrepreneur, industrialist, media proprietor, and investor. He is the richest person in the world according to the Forbes' Real-Time Billionaires ranking.</p>
      <br/>
      <h3 class="text-center">Public Key Cryptography</h3>
      <br/>
            <p>Bezos understood that in order to create trust among amazon users he had to create a security fort to secure people’s most valuable assets, their wallet. Encryption was created using the public key cryptography method, created by Martin E. Hellman and Whitfield Diffie. This allowed the sender to lock the content and only the intended party had the code to release the content, not even the receiver was blocked from receiving the code.</p>

      <br/><br/>
      <h3 class="text-center">The Big Burst</h3>
      <br/>
      <p>Searching for the approval of Wall Street, Ebay hire a serious businessperson by the name of Meg Whitman. She was an experienced marketer for Walt Disney and with this move EBay launched its public offering in 1989. But the IPO window opened up and for Ebay and within days the company’s stock blew up. Likewise, investors fixed their eyes back at Amazon. Henry Blodget, a wall street analyst, led the efforts in the rise of Amazon stocks and caused other investors to purchase Amazon stock which soared stock prices. </p>
      <div class="text-center">
    <img src="Images/ecommerce.jpg" alt="shopping chart" style="width:400px;height:200px;">
      </div>
      <br/>
      <p>The word was out, ecommerce was the way to get rich quick! These predictions caused a media frenzy and developers raced to create dot com websites mindlessly.  As stocks doubled for Ebay and Amazon in a matter of months, this motivated startup companies and look-alikes to surface all around the country. Investors flocked to the stocks of companies with a dot com at the end of its website, encouraging the madness. Investors knew that some ecommerce would not survive but their greed enabled their poor decisions. And then…
         Day traders enter the market and turn the stock market into a casino. The entrance of all these players with no real financial backing was a recipe for disaster. Day traders and self-serving wall street analysts, like Henry Blodget, inflated the market with their predictions but there was no revenue and then the market Brust!

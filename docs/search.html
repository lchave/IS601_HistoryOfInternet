      <h1 class="text-center"> The Internet Search</h1>
      <br/> <br/>
      <p> Before Google the internet was an unsearchable tool. With so much data built in it but no way to bring it to a single repository. What good was the world wide web if you could not search it. Cracking the code to this issue would allow for the reduction in search time.
          Before then web search consisted of hours of clicking through an array of links until you found the information you needed. It was no different than reading through a bunch of encyclopedia books and material before landing on content related and useful for your project.

      <h1 class="text-center"> Pioneers of the search engine: Yahoo, Excite, and Google.com</h1>
      <br/>
      <p>Cracking the code to this riddle came by accident upon a pair of Stanford students searching for information to win a virtual basketball game. While in their dorm room David Filo and Jerry Yang went online and gathered enormous file of basketball related information. This took lots of time when the thought of creating an efficient search mode came to mind. This was the birth of Yahoo.com.</p>
      <p>David Filo and Jerry Yang would go on to create a directory to provide a list of instructions for internet users for the compilation of information. A rival company rouse after Yahoo with an improved database that automated queried searches, as opposed to the manual laborious option offered by Yahoo. The company was Excited.com. And then there was Google.</p>
      <p>Google was formed from the assumption that pages were only as important as they were relevant to the public. Google’s founders are Larry Page and Sergey Brin, both also from Stanford University. Larry and Sergey along with their computer science professor would send time discussing search tactics and observing the traffic among the university websites. At a moment in time google got so big among campus users that Stanford told the pair that that Google would have to move off campus. The Google’s search feature allowed for the most relevant and popular links to appear at the top of a query search to make it easier and very much improve on the internet user experience.

  <h1 class="text-center">How would the internet and search engines generate revenue</h1>
      <br/><br/>
      <p> The issue in getting these tools to the public sector involved money, these tech students with the help of their Professors would reach out venture capitalist in search for a start-up opportunity. Yahoo was the first company to discover a way to generate income, discussed next:</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Originally upon Yahoo’s inception, they felt tremendous pressure to find a way to generate money. The founders played around with the idea of adding banner ads. Preplexed that is would discourage yahoo users the yahoo, hestitated to move on this idea. Yahoo, seem to believe that having banner ads would convolute users screen space and promote things they were not interested in however, the opposite occurred. Once the banner ads went up it seemed to generate more traffic. The advertisements ignited an array of interest to other pages.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Excite.com was still on the market and making headway when Google appeared with their specialization of searching. Yet they were no match for Google’s innovation. Google pitched their idea to companies and after some rejections even from Excite.com, Google founders connected with a former Professor. The fear was that Google would be another search mode and after the crash of Dot Com investors were alarmed. But the Professor knew this was something special. They would then be connected to venture capitalist Andy Bechtolsheim and John Doerr. Google was offered multiple offers for a start-up but soon realized that (just like yahoo) generating revenue was vital for their existence. Likewise, Google tuned to banner ads however this time the advertisements would be displayed in the manner of looking through the yellow pages for specific contact information. The development was not authentically Google’s idea but it certainly was the answer to a even better internet user experience. Ads were pulled organically by query keywords. This feature would later be coined Google Ad-words.</p>
